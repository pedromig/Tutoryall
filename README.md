## About The Project

It's often hard to find someone who is willing to help you with your doubts/academic struggles
or learning needs and perhaps that someone is closer than you think.

Our app aims to close the gap between tutors and apprentices!

* Costumers / Users:  People who need to learn and the tutors that can teach them.
* Benefits: The tutors can advertise their services while the learners can more easily find tutors.
